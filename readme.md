# Julia's Sweet Version of Spotify.me

This is a funky hybrid of some ES6 (using const! using const for FUNCTIONS!) and ES5 (when I couldn't get ES6 to do what I wanted it to do!). I feel like this should need a transpiler or something, but it's working fine for me locally? So... how bout that.

## Original readme

Use Ajax to load data from the Spotify API! A user should be able to:

## Basic Requirements:

 - Enter a keyword to seach for.
 - Select "artist" or "track" as the search type.
 - Have the names of all search results print as a list.
 
## Keep going:

 - Add a "Showing X-X of X results found" message.
 - Setup pagination links for accessing the next page of results.
